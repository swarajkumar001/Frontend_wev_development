                <h3 class="cursive">COMMENTING</h3>
                <p>
                    Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer. Name of the module, purpose of the module, description of the module, original author, modifications and authors who modified code with a description on why it was modified were components of an early commenting practice.

                <h3 class="cursive">GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
                <p>
                    Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not replace them with meaningful names. To prevent this confusion and utter waste of time, descriptive names should be used.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3 class="uppercase">SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
                <p>
                    The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain result, developers may use complex logic but this should be minimised while writing a good code. The next developer who uses the code may use it for a different purpose and may not even completely understand or utilise the complex logic. Simple code does not always depend on the length of the code. The code must also be conceptually simple. An added advantage is if the code is also suitably compact. More code can be viewed on a page and programmer keystrokes can be reduced.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
                <p>
                    Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code contains values referring to ‘absolute parameters’ such as file names, URLs or IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is of a different design. A good programmer will parametrize these variables and configure them so the application can also be run and maintained in a different environment.
                </p>

            <li>
                <h3>TESTING</h3>
                <p>
                    Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test cases must be planned while the code is being written, and they are developed while an application is coded.
                </p>

                <h3>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3>
                <p>
                    While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors throughout. Though it is fine for smaller programs to be debugged after they have been written, this becomes a bottleneck for longer programmes. The best practice, therefore, is to debug each module as soon as it has been created.

            <li>
                <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
                <p>
                    Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The installation files should be kept to a minimum and updated regularly. Unused code or anything that is not necessary should not be installed.
                </p>
