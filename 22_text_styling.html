        he Indian subcontinent had witnessed the cohesive concentration of many Empires in the quest for
         control of military power, and governance of the State. As time rolled by, societal norms found
          an ethos in the workplace, the system of rights and privileges, and service under the flag.

        The Indian Army, as we know it today became operational after the Country gained independence from 
        British colonialism. The Indian Army's HQ is located in New Delhi and functions under the Chief of 
        Army Staff (COAS), who is responsible for the command, control, and administration as a whole. 
        The Army is divided into six operational commands (field armies) and one training command, each 
        under the command of a Lieutenant General, who has an equal status to the Vice-Chief of Army Staff
         (VCOAS), working under the control of Army HQ in New Delhi.
